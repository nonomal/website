# Add watch together function for video sites

If you are a video site owner, you can add the Watch Together feature to your site by adding just one line of code to introduce JS.


`<script src="https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/VideoTogether/VideoTogether@latest/release/extension.website.user.js"></script>`

Note that if your site's video player is nested in an iframe, you need to add this line of code to each level of html. Otherwise the plug-in will prompt the page no video.

All code of the project is open source, any questions can join the page under the exchange group consultation.
